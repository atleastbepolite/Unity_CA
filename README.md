1. Jong Woo Ha, Intro To Unity A1
2. Crazy Arcade
3. Move players to navigate and place bomb, destroy boxes for powerups, kill other players 
4. (wasd + shift(bomb)) for p1, (up,left,right,down + right ctrl(bomb)) for p2 
5. The biggest, or most surprising, part that you struggled with while working on the project:
    1.I had and still have a issue with making the game(round) reload when one or both players have died
      So, when one or both playable characters have died, you will need to manually shut down the program 
      and rerun, sorry. 
    2.I wanted to make the bombs exlode instantly, upon being contacted by another bomb's explosion, but failed, and am still finding ways to make this work. 
       This would have allowed players to make more strategic moves by connecting bombs with time intervals and making it more confusing for the enemy to dodge
       the explosions of the bomb that can be strategically connected to attack with various numbers of attack patterns. 
    3.I wanted to make players only killable by the explosions of the bomb iff over 50% of the character is touched by the explosion. This would have allowed
      individuals to navigate around the map, with only half of their body on each sides of the two adjacent grids (between two grids), connect the bombs in a much more 
      strategic fashion, making the game much more enjoyable and strategy-worthy. 
6. The biggest, or most suprising, success you had while working on the project:
   The fact that I was able to mimic one of my childhood's favorite and most played game was quite fascinating.
7. Anything else you want to tell me about how it went/what you tried to do/etc:
   I will definitely try to add more features, even potentially turn this into an online multiplayer game.
